        [00:00.00]Edge Of My Life - Manafest
        [00:03.36]Lyrics by：Adam Messinger/Chris Greenwood
        [00:06.73]Composed by：Adam Messinger/Chris Greenwood
        [00:10.10]Last dollar just got spent
        [00:11.65]First of the month comes
        [00:12.95]Got to pay rent
        [00:14.03]Where'd the money go
        [00:14.95]Slipping through my hands
        [00:16.94]I'm working with these hands
        [00:19.19]Little Johnny needs a lunch box
        [00:20.98]Little Suzy needs clothes and it won't stop
        [00:23.18]Banks calling us up
        [00:24.28]And they don't care
        [00:26.07]It's more than I can bare
        [00:28.31]I gotta gotta believe
        [00:30.87]I can more then survive
        [00:33.15]Still one trick up my sleeve
        [00:35.26]We're gonna make this one shine
        [00:37.59]I gotta gotta believe
        [00:39.98]I can more then survive
        [00:42.25]Still one trick up my sleeve
        [00:44.39]We're gonna make this one shine
        [00:47.05]I I'm at the edge of my life
        [00:50.12]I got no time to think twice
        [00:52.63]When I'm standing with the weight
        [00:54.05]Of the world on my shoulders
        [00:55.99]I I'm gonna fight the good fight
        [00:59.27]Cause I I know I'll get by
        [01:01.78]When I battle everyday through the pain like a soldier
        [01:14.05]Mom crying on the sofa
        [01:15.76]Dad comes home but he's not sober
        [01:17.93]Where'd the family go
        [01:18.95]Up in smoke again
        [01:20.92]Feels just like sinking sand
        [01:23.15]Heard shouts in the backyard
        [01:24.58]Hey
        [01:25.29]Sirens ringing from a cop car
        [01:27.14]It's a rough day
        [01:28.18]For this family man
        [01:29.98]I'm praying with these hands
        [01:32.38]I gotta gotta believe
        [01:34.85]I can more then survive
        [01:37.17]Still one trick up my sleeve
        [01:39.26]We're gonna make this one shine
        [01:41.59]I gotta gotta believe
        [01:44.00]I can more then survive
        [01:46.29]Still one trick up my sleeve
        [01:48.44]We're gonna make this one shine
        [01:51.05]I I'm at the edge of my life
        [01:54.21]I got no time to think twice
        [01:56.75]When I'm standing with the weight
        [01:58.05]Of the world on my shoulders
        [01:59.99]I I'm gonna fight the good fight
        [02:03.24]Cause I I know I'll get by
        [02:05.86]When I battle everyday through the pain like a soldier
        [02:18.10]Just don't look down
        [02:22.00]And you'll never fall
        [02:27.18]I gotta gotta believe
        [02:29.73]I can more then survive
        [02:31.98]Still one trick up my sleeve
        [02:34.14]We're gonna make this one shine
        [02:36.46]I gotta gotta believe
        [02:38.89]I can more then survive
        [02:41.17]Still one trick up my sleeve
        [02:45.74]I I'm at the edge of my life
        [02:48.89]I got no time to think twice
        [02:51.48]When I'm standing with the weight
        [02:52.89]Of the world on my shoulders
        [02:54.90]I I'm gonna fight the good fight
        [02:58.03]Cause I I know I'll get by
        [03:00.68]When I battle everyday through the pain like a soldier
